- LDA: Linear Discriminant Analysis for supervised dimensionality reduction.
- t-SNE: t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding for visualization.
- Autoencoders: Neural networks for nonlinear dimensionality reduction.

⚙️ Model Training & Evaluation

- Cross-Validation: K-Fold validation for robust model evaluation.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters.
- Grid Search: Exhaustive hyperparameter search.
- Random Search: Randomized hyperparameter optimization.

📈 Performance Metrics
- Confusion Matrix: TP, TN, FP, FN visualization.
- Accuracy: (TP + TN) / Total predictions.
- Precision: TP / (TP + FP).
- Recall (Sensitivity): TP / (TP + FN).
- F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- ROC Curve: Visualizing classifier performance.
- AUC Score: Area Under ROC Curve.

Week 5 

📈 Regression Models
- Simple Linear Regression: Single predictor, linear relationship.
- Multiple Linear Regression: Multiple predictors, linear relationship.
- Polynomial Regression: Non-linear relationships via polynomial features.
- Ridge Regression (L2): Prevents overfitting with L2 regularization.
- Lasso Regression (L1): Feature selection via L1 regularization.
- ElasticNet Regression: Combines L1 & L2 penalties (Ridge + Lasso).

🔍 Classification Models
- Logistic Regression: Binary/multi-class classification (sigmoid function).
- Naive Bayes: Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes’ theorem.
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): Instance-based learning (distance metrics).
- Decision Trees: Rule-based splits (entropy/Gini impurity).
- Random Forest: Ensemble of decision trees (bagging + feature randomness).
- Support Vector Machines (SVM): Maximizes margin using kernels (linear, RBF).
